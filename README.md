Introduction
Today we're going to be looking over a dataset created by Barry Becker pertaining to the 1994 Census for the United States.

Purpose
What we're going to be figuring out with it initially is whether or not that people make over $50,000 or under that per year with the information that we obtain with the initial data. This will help us provide answers to our hypothetical employee-the government-to better tax the people by predicting their tax brackets based on their information. Which in turn may help them through more knowledgable tax policies.

Then we're going to come up with an additional question and apply it to the same data and see where that takes us.
